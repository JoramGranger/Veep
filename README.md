# Venue Marketplace API

The Venue Marketplace API is a RESTful service built using Python, FastAPI, and MongoDB. The API allows users to manage venues, including creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting venue records. Additional features like payments, users, authentication, reviews, and bookings will be added as the project grows.

## Features

- **Venues:** Create, retrieve, and manage venues.
- **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication for secure access (planned).
- **Payments:** Handle payment processing (planned).
- **Reviews:** Allow users to leave reviews for venues (planned).
- **Bookings:** Manage venue bookings (planned).
- **API Versioning:** Support for multiple API versions.
- **Caching:** Improve performance with caching (planned).
